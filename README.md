ActivityPlanner is a simple GUI-based task list application
where users can write a list of tasks to be completed with
names, descriptions and deadlines. It comes with a calendar
that reflects the list visually as well, and allows multiple
profiles with their own lists to be stored and logged into. 
This project was for CSCE 3444 Software Engineering, where we 
learned the SDLC and how to create GUI applications as a team.
